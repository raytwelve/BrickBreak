# BrickBreak

A simple java game.  This has only one level.
This game is very similar to the classic Brick Break game, where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to deflect the bouncing ball back up towards the bricks. The objective is to destroy all the bricks without letting the ball hit the ground. This version of the game includes a number of special bricks that, when destroyed, have various special power-ups.
